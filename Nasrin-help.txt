ATM Projecct Help:

1)	If you are using Homestead and you have Ubuntu or OSX you need to add "atmapp.test" to your "/etc/hosts" file along and direct it to the ip address specified in your homestead.yml
2)  Go into your homestead folder and run "vagrant provision". 
3)  Log into your vagrant box using "vagrant ssh" command.
4)  Navigate into the project directory in the virtual machine.
5)  Install packages by using composer command "composer insatll"
2)	rename “.env.example” to “.env” and make change based on your database config
6)  Generate a encryption key for the project by running "artisan key:generate".
3)	Run “php artisan migrate” command - it’ll make required tables
4)	Run “php artisan db:seed” I’ve added some default queries for example user has accounts with cart and pin number. I assume my user swapped card with number: ”1034982”, pin number is : “12345”
5)	User can login and deposit, withdraw and transfer between accounts. User also can see last 5 transactions in both checking and saving. + for me ;)
